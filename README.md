An FTDI USB-I2C module (for example FT232h), with a HIH7xxx sensor attached to it.

Install
-----------
in folder domoticz/plugins  :
git clone https://github.com/nijmeijer/domoticz_hih7000_i2c_ftdi hih7000_ftdi
This will create a folder named hih7000_ftdi, containing the file "plugin.py" as expected by domoticz

Restart domoticz, and add the new HARDWARE.
